# Mountain Descent

The theme of 2018's retro inspired game jam is "Travel". My team and I has came up with the game Mountain Descent. The player takes control of a girl who needs to get a running start to get up the mountain. The goal of the game is to use mountains in order to gain speed to go up the mountain. This is done by tapping and/or holding spacebar in order to make the girl heavier. The game play mainly revolves around timings of your controls so that the girl sprints down mountains and runs up them.
